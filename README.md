Planning a trip sounds exciting, but it often becomes stressful when everything has to be 
organized. From choosing where to go to making sure the budget fits, travelers usually end up using 
multiple apps or websites to manage flights, hotels, attractions, and reminders. This makes travel 
planning messy and confusing, especially when planning with others. “Destino” is designed to solve 
these travel headaches by offering a digital platform that brings all planning tools into one seamless 
website. Rather than switching between different apps, users can handle every stage of trip 
preparation for themselves in one place with Destino. The website lets users create detailed daily 
itineraries, helping them lay out every part of their trip from arrival to departure. Destino also 
allows users to search and explore popular destinations, displaying curated information and 
recommendations that save time and inspire new ideas. Destino keeps everything organized, making 
travelers spend less time managing and more time looking forward to their adventures. With just a 
few clicks, users can quickly build itineraries that include places to visit, activities, and notes to 
remember. Destino takes trip planning a step further by connecting to trusted services like Google 
Maps for maps and place details, as well as Open Weather for live weather forecasts. As users add 
destinations and activities, Destino can automatically show maps, calculate routes, suggest nearby 
points of interest, and provide up-to-date weather information. This helps users make better choices, 
such as picking the best time for an outdoor adventure or finding a popular restaurant nearby. All 
essential trip details, dates, reminders, and notes are neatly tucked away in one profile, making it 
easy to revisit, edit, or share at any time before departure. With Destino, planning starts weeks in 
advance or the night before departure without the stress of switching between platforms. The 
platform saves travelers time by offering a one-stop solution for all their needs: itinerary building, 
budgeting, destination research, and personalized recommendations. Destino’s mission is to give 
travelers convenience, control, and excitement from the very start of their journey, ensuring that 
careful planning enhances rather than detracts from the overall travel experience
